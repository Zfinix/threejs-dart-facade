# THREE.js Dart Interop Facade

# Disclaimer

This is a Dart JS interop facade generated with [dts-converter](https://github.com/blockforest/dts-converter),
which takes TypeScript .d.ts definitions as input. [Source definition](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/cc3d223a946f661eff871787edeb0fcb8f0db156/threejs) taken from DefinitelyTyped.

While Dart Analyzer reports the resulting library as free of errors, nothing except what's needed by the demo has been tested.
The library will only be lightly maintained.
